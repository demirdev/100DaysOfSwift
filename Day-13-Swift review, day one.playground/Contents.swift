// Float and Double ==> Always use Double

// Let's look at two more data types, called Float and Double. This is Swift's way of storing numbers with a fractional component, such as 3.1, 3.141, 3.1415926, and -16777216.5. There are two data types for this because you get to choose how much accuracy you want, but most of the time it doesn't matter so the official Apple recommendation is always to use Double because it has the highest accuracy.
var latitude: Double
latitude = 36.16667

var longitude: Float
// OK
longitude = -86.783333
// 1234568
longitude = -1234567.7899

// For more accurate use Double
var longitudeMoreAccurate: Double
longitudeMoreAccurate = -1234567.7899

// Double has limit
// -123456789123789.8
longitudeMoreAccurate = -123456789123789.78333


// Boolean

var stayOutTooLate: Bool

var nothingInBrain: Bool

// You can put loops inside loops if you want. Be careful.

// Swift can apply some evaluation to your case statements in order to match against variables.

case 2...3:

// One thing you should know is that switch/case blocks in Swift don't fall through like they do in some other languages you might have seen. If you're used to writing break in your case blocks, you should know this isn't needed in Swift.

// Instead, you use the fallthrough keyword to make one case fall into the next â€“ it's effectively the opposite. Of course, if you have no idea what any of this means, that's even better: don't worry about it!
